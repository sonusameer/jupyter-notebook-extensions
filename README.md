Writing Your Own Extensions
It's possible to write your own extensions to add anything you can think of to Jupyter Notebooks. The documentation is scarce, but try looking through some of the other examples to get the basics. Here's the extent of the existing documentation.

The point of this repository is to develop new Jupyter Notebook extensions. Any of the extensions here should be added to the nbextensions subdirectory of the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions library installed with pip. Youd can find the location of the library using pip show jupyter_contrib_nbextensions.

For example, I place the new extensions at /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions

Each extension has three parts: name.yaml file with configuration, README.md with documentation, and main.js with the Javascript code.

Feel free to contribute your own extensions or add on to those available here.
